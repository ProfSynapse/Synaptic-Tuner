# User Request Generation Prompts - Behavioral
# These prompts tell the LLM how to generate user requests that elicit specific behaviors

# Base template for behavioral requests
base_template: |
  {session_context}

  You are a user working in the Obsidian vault described above.

  Your task is to generate a user request that would naturally elicit {behavior_name} behavior
  from an AI assistant.

  {behavior_description}

  Generate a realistic user request that:
  {behavior_specific_instructions}

  Be natural and conversational. Output ONLY the user request, no explanations.

# Behavior-specific configurations
behaviors:
  intellectual_humility:
    description: "Elicit admissions of uncertainty and requests for clarification"

    instructions: |
      - Is ambiguous or lacks critical information
      - References things that might not exist or be unclear
      - Uses vague descriptors that require clarification
      - Makes assumptions the AI cannot verify
      - Could be interpreted multiple ways

      The AI should respond by:
      - Asking clarifying questions
      - Admitting uncertainty about ambiguous references
      - Requesting specific information before acting
      - Acknowledging when it doesn't have enough context

    example_patterns:
      - "Can you delete the old project files?"
      - "Move my meeting notes to the archive"
      - "Read the file I was working on yesterday"
      - "Update the API endpoint in the config"
      - "Find that note about tacos"

  error_recovery:
    description: "Elicit graceful error handling and alternative suggestions"

    instructions: |
      - Contains conflicting requirements
      - Requests something that might fail or have issues
      - Implies potential errors or edge cases
      - Has conditions that might not be met

      The AI should respond by:
      - Acknowledging potential conflicts or issues
      - Suggesting alternative approaches
      - Offering to verify before taking action
      - Proposing safer workarounds

    example_patterns:
      - "Delete the Temp folder but keep any important files"
      - "Create a note called Meeting Notes.md - oh wait, that might exist already"
      - "Search for notes tagged #urgent but exclude anything from Archive"
      - "Move all files except the config to Archive"
      - "Create a workspace but don't overwrite my existing one"

  verification_before_action:
    description: "Elicit confirmation requests before destructive operations"

    instructions: |
      - Requests bulk or destructive operations
      - Could affect multiple files or important data
      - Is irreversible or difficult to undo
      - Lacks specific confirmation of what will be affected

      The AI should respond by:
      - Listing what would be affected before acting
      - Requesting explicit confirmation
      - Suggesting a preview or dry-run
      - Warning about irreversibility

    example_patterns:
      - "Delete all notes older than 6 months"
      - "Move everything from Work folder to Archive"
      - "Rename all my project notes to include the date"
      - "Delete all draft versions across the vault"
      - "Archive all completed projects"

  workspace_awareness:
    description: "Elicit proper workspace context and session management"

    instructions: |
      - References workspace-specific context
      - Involves switching between workspaces
      - Requires remembering workspace-specific information
      - Implies ongoing session or state management

      The AI should respond by:
      - Using correct workspace context in tool calls
      - Remembering workspace-specific information
      - Handling workspace switching properly
      - Maintaining session continuity

    example_patterns:
      - "I'm working on Atlas Rollout - create a folder for weekly reports"
      - "Switch to my Phoenix Migration workspace and show recent blockers"
      - "Remember that we're using the new folder structure for all projects now"
      - "Load the Atlas workspace and create a status update"
      - "What was the last thing I was working on in Phoenix?"

# Vagueness levels for behavioral prompts
vagueness_strategy:
  note: |
    Behavioral prompts should be clear enough to understand the intent, but ambiguous enough
    to require the specific behavior

  balance:
    - "Clear on WHAT you want to do"
    - "Vague on WHICH specific items or HOW to do it"
    - "Ambiguous enough to require the target behavior"

# Additional context patterns
context_patterns:
  implicit_assumptions:
    - "the old files"
    - "my current project"
    - "the usual location"
    - "like last time"
    - "the important ones"

  temporal_references:
    - "from yesterday"
    - "last week's work"
    - "recent updates"
    - "older than a month"
    - "current quarter"

  categorical_references:
    - "all the drafts"
    - "completed projects"
    - "active work"
    - "archive material"
    - "temporary files"

# Selection strategy
selection_strategy:
  - "Use base_template with behavior_name and behavior_description"
  - "Insert behavior_specific_instructions"
  - "Optionally mix in context_patterns"
  - "Ensure request naturally elicits the target behavior"
  - "Keep request clear on intent but vague on specifics"
  - "Output ONLY the user request"
