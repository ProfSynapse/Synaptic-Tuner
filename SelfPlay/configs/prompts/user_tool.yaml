# User Request Generation Prompts - Tool-Based (Prompt 2)
# These prompts tell the LLM how to generate realistic, VAGUE user requests for tool-based scenarios

# Base template used for all tool-based requests
base_template: |
  {session_context}

  You are a user working in the Obsidian vault described above. You need to perform a task
  that would use one of these {agent_name} tools: {tool_list}

  Generate a realistic, natural user request. IMPORTANT - be VAGUE like a real user:

  ❌ DON'T be overly specific:
  - "Read the file at Projects/Active/Q4-Goals.md"
  - "Create a folder called 'Meeting Notes' in Projects/2024/"
  - "Search for the exact phrase 'deployment strategy' in Archive/"

  ✅ DO be natural and vague:
  - Misspell file names: "Can you read my Q4 gols file?"
  - Forget exact locations: "I think I have a goals file somewhere in projects?"
  - Describe conceptually: "Read my notes about quarterly planning"
  - Be casual: "Find that deployment thing I wrote last week"
  - Be ambiguous: "Delete the old project files" (which files? which project?)
  - Mix precision and vagueness: "Create a folder for meeting notes" (where? what structure?)

  Real users:
  - Don't remember exact file paths
  - Describe things from memory
  - Use casual, conversational language
  - Might refer to content, not file names
  - Are often ambiguous or incomplete

  Generate ONE realistic, vague user request that would require using {agent_name} tools.
  Don't explain or add commentary - just output the user request.

# Agent-specific variations (optional - adds context for certain agents)
agent_variations:
  vaultManager:
    additional_context: |
      You're organizing your vault, moving files around, or managing folder structure.
      You might not know exact paths, or be unsure where things should go.

  contentManager:
    additional_context: |
      You're working with note content - creating, editing, or reading notes.
      You might describe what you want to write about, or reference notes by topic not filename.

  memoryManager:
    additional_context: |
      You're managing your workspace sessions or states.
      You might not remember exact session names, or describe when you worked on something.

  vaultLibrarian:
    additional_context: |
      You're searching for something in your vault.
      You might remember partial content, wrong file names, or vague topics.

  agentManager:
    additional_context: |
      You're working with custom agents or AI features.
      You might not remember exact agent names, or describe what you want the agent to do.

  commandManager:
    additional_context: |
      You're trying to execute Obsidian commands.
      You might not know the exact command name, or describe what you want to do.

# Vagueness level variations (randomly select how vague the request should be)
vagueness_levels:
  minimal:
    description: "Slightly vague - user knows most details but not all"
    weight: 0.3
    examples:
      - "Can you read my quarterly goals file? I think it's in Projects"
      - "Create a folder for Q4 planning somewhere in my work area"
      - "Search for notes about the database migration"

  moderate:
    description: "Moderately vague - user knows general area but fuzzy on specifics"
    weight: 0.5
    examples:
      - "Read that file about our goals... quarterly something?"
      - "I need a new folder for planning stuff"
      - "Find anything I wrote about databases last month"

  high:
    description: "Very vague - user barely remembers or is very casual"
    weight: 0.2
    examples:
      - "Can you read my goals file or whatever it's called"
      - "Make a folder for my planning things"
      - "Did I write something about migrations?"
