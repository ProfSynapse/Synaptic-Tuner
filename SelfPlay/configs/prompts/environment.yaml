    prompt: |
      Generate a realistic Obsidian vault workspace environment for a user.

      Create a simple, focused workspace with:
      - A clear purpose (e.g., "Daily Notes", "Quick Capture", "Reading List")
      - A root folder (e.g., "Journal/", "Inbox/", "Books/")
      - 3-5 files in a simple structure (1-2 subfolders max)
      - Realistic but simple file names

      Output format:
      Workspace Name: {name}
      Description: {what the user uses this workspace for}
      Root Folder: {root path}

      Folder Structure:
      {root}/
      ├── {file1.md}
      ├── {file2.md}
      └── {subfolder}/
          ├── {file3.md}
          └── {file4.md}

      Make it feel real but keep it simple - this is a focused workspace.

  complex:

    prompt: |
      Generate a realistic Obsidian vault workspace environment for a user.

      Create a complex, realistic workspace that feels LIVED-IN:
      - A clear purpose (e.g., "Project Management", "Research Notes", "Work Vault")
      - A root folder (e.g., "Projects/", "Research/", "Work/")
      - 10-15 files across 3-5 nested subfolders
      - REALISTIC imperfections:
        * Some files have dates, some don't
        * Inconsistent naming (some camelCase, some kebab-case, some spaces)
        * Mix of organization levels (some well-organized, some messy)
        * A few generic names like "notes.md", "draft.md", "temp.md"
        * Some folders might be empty or have just 1 file

      Output format:
      Workspace Name: {name}
      Description: {detailed description of what this workspace is for}
      Root Folder: {root path}

      Folder Structure:
      {root}/
      ├── {subfolder1}/
      │   ├── {file1.md}
      │   ├── {file2.md}
      │   └── {nested-subfolder}/
      │       └── {file3.md}
      ├── {subfolder2}/
      │   ├── {file4.md}
      │   └── {file5.md}
      ├── {file6.md}
      └── {file7.md}

      Make it feel like a REAL person's workspace - not perfectly organized, but functional.
      Include specific domain content (e.g., if it's a "Research" workspace, use academic-sounding file names).

  project_focused:
    description: "Project management workspace (structured but realistic)"
    weight: 0.2
    prompt: |
      Generate a realistic Obsidian vault workspace for PROJECT MANAGEMENT.

      Create a project-oriented workspace with:
      - A specific project name (e.g., "Atlas Rollout", "Phoenix Migration", "Q4 Planning")
      - Root folder: Projects/{project-name}/
      - Standard project structure:
        * Planning/ (roadmaps, specs, goals)
        * Active/ (current work, sprints, tasks)
        * Archive/ (completed work)
        * Meetings/ (meeting notes, standups)
        * Resources/ (reference docs, templates)
      - 8-12 files across these folders
      - Realistic project file names (with dates, versions, or status indicators)

      Output format:
      Workspace Name: {project name}
      Description: {what this project is about and current status}
      Root Folder: Projects/{project-name}/

      Folder Structure:
      Projects/{project-name}/
      ├── Planning/
      │   ├── {roadmap or spec file}
      │   └── {goals file}
      ├── Active/
      │   ├── {sprint or current work}
      │   └── {tasks or todos}
      ├── Meetings/
      │   ├── {meeting note 1}
      │   └── {meeting note 2}
      ├── Archive/
      │   └── {old file}
      └── README.md

      Make it feel like an active, ongoing project.

  knowledge_base:
    description: "Knowledge base / research workspace (topic-organized)"
    weight: 0.1
    prompt: |
      Generate a realistic Obsidian vault workspace for KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT or RESEARCH.

      Create a knowledge-oriented workspace with:
      - A topic or domain (e.g., "Machine Learning Notes", "Philosophy Reading", "Programming Reference")
      - Root folder: {topic-name}/
      - Topic-based organization (folders by subtopic, concept, or category)
      - 10-15 notes with descriptive names
      - Some notes might reference each other (like "linked concepts")
      - Include some meta-files (index.md, MOC.md, tags.md, etc.)

      Output format:
      Workspace Name: {topic or domain}
      Description: {what knowledge this workspace contains}
      Root Folder: {topic-root}/

      Folder Structure:
      {topic-root}/
      ├── {subtopic1}/
      │   ├── {concept1.md}
      │   ├── {concept2.md}
      │   └── {examples.md}
      ├── {subtopic2}/
      │   ├── {concept3.md}
      │   └── {notes.md}
      ├── Index.md
      ├── MOC.md
      └── Reading-List.md

      Make it feel like someone building a second brain or personal wiki.

# Metadata
selection_strategy: "weighted"  # Use weights above to randomly select variation
default_variation: "complex"     # Use this if no variation specified

# Post-processing instructions
post_processing:
  - "Ensure all file names end with .md"
  - "Ensure folder paths end with /"
  - "Ensure realistic names (no placeholders like 'file1', 'folder2')"
  - "Vary the depth (some workspaces flat, some nested)"
  - "Include at least one folder and at least 3 files"
