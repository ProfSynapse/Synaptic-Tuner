RESTful Design\\n\\nFollow REST architectural constraints:\\n- **Client-Server**: Clear separation of concerns\\n- **Stateless**: Each request contains all needed information\\n- **Cacheable**: Responses explicitly indicate cacheability\\n- **Layered System**: Client cannot tell if connected directly to server\\n- **Uniform Interface**: Consistent resource identification and manipulation\\n\\n### 2. Resource-Oriented\\n\\nDesign around resources, not actions:\\n\\n```\\nGOOD:\\nGET /api/users/{id}\\nPOST /api/users\\nPUT /api/users/{id}\\nDELETE /api/users/{id}\\n\\nBAD:\\nGET /api/getUser?id=123\\nPOST /api/createUser\\nPOST /api/updateUser\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Consistent Naming\\n\\n- Use plural nouns for collections: `/users`, `/products`\\n- Use kebab-case for multi-word resources: `/user-profiles`\\n- Avoid verbs in URLs (use HTTP methods instead)\\n- Use subcollections for relationships: `/users/{id}/orders`\\n\\n### 4. Proper HTTP Methods\\n\\n- **GET**: Retrieve resources (safe, idempotent)\\n- **POST**: Create new resources\\n- **PUT**: Update entire resource (idempotent)\\n- **PATCH**: Partial update\\n- **DELETE**: Remove resource (idempotent)\\n\\n### 5. Meaningful Status Codes\\n\\n**Success:**\\n- 200 OK: Successful GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE\\n- 201 Created: Successful POST\\n- 204 No Content: Successful request with no body\\n\\n**Client Errors:**\\n- 400 Bad Request: Invalid syntax\\n- 401 Unauthorized: Authentication required\\n- 403 Forbidden: Insufficient permissions\\n- 404 Not Found: Resource doesn't exist\\n- 409 Conflict: Duplicate or conflicting resource\\n- 422 Unprocessable Entity: Validation errors\\n- 429 Too Many Requests: Rate limit exceeded\\n\\n**Server Errors:**\\n- 500 Internal Server Error: Unexpected error\\n- 503 Service Unavailable: Temporary unavailability\\n\\n### 6. Consistent Error Format\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"error\\\": {\\n    \\\"code\\\": \\\"VALIDATION_ERROR\\\",\\n    \\\"message\\\": \\\"Invalid input data\\\",\\n    \\\"details\\\": [\\n      {\\n        \\\"field\\\": \\\"email\\\",\\n        \\\"message\\\": \\\"Invalid email format\\\"\\n      }\\n    ],\\n    \\\"requestId\\\": \\\"req_abc123\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 7.
